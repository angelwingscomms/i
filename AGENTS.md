# General
- always search the net when it might help
- always follow the patterns in the example files perfectly

# Code Style
- Naming: always snake_case for vars/functions; db payload, type defs, request JSON and page load return value keys always single letters.
- Styling: Tailwind utilities only; no inline styles/style blocks
- DB/Qdrant: Multi-tenancy, single collection 'i'; tenant-id on payload field `s`
- Conciseness: no vars for single-use; code minimally
- when styling, always use vars in src/styles/\_variables.css. always use Tailwind only. DON'T USE STYLEBLOCKS OR INLINE STYLES.
- never start the dev server
- always use all lowercase for all UI text
- always run `npm run lint` before ending
- fonts go in static/fonts

# Svelte MCP
You are able to use the Svelte MCP server, where you have access to comprehensive Svelte 5 and SvelteKit documentation. Here's how to use the available tools effectively:

## Available MCP Tools:
### 1. list-sections
Use this FIRST to discover all available documentation sections. Returns a structured list with titles, use_cases, and paths.
When asked about Svelte or SvelteKit topics, ALWAYS use this tool at the start of the chat to find relevant sections.

### 2. get-documentation
Retrieves full documentation content for specific sections. Accepts single or multiple sections.
After calling the list-sections tool, you MUST analyze the returned documentation sections (especially the use_cases field) and then use the get-documentation tool to fetch ALL documentation sections that are relevant for the user's task.

### 3. svelte-autofixer
Analyzes Svelte code and returns issues and suggestions.
You MUST use this tool whenever writing Svelte code before sending it to the user. Keep calling it until no issues or suggestions are returned.

### 4. playground-link
Generates a Svelte Playground link with the provided code.
After completing the code, ask the user if they want a playground link. Only call this tool after user confirmation and NEVER if code was written to files in their project.
