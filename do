users can send files in chat
files are uploaded to ibm storage and the urls, just the url strings, are stored in message point payload field 'f' as string array
in chat ui, for a message, if messsage.f is not empty, for each link, render a minimal horizontal widget that shows just the filename, with a small icon that shows if it's an image, audio or doc file (any other type of file) maybe also shows the file extension suchly, like an icon; also for each widget, if audio, let there be a sleek minimal audio player, just for playing and seeking the audio, if image, let the image open in a fullscreen modal on click, swiping left and right on the opened image goes to the previous and next image. each widget would also have a download button
